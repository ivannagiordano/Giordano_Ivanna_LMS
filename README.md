// NEW PART OF LMS - a console-based Java application that allows users to manage a collection of books. Users can load books from a text file, remove books by ID or title, check books in or out, and display the current contents of the library. The project is implemented using object-oriented principles and consists of three core classes< book, library, and module2 >// 

// the main class is module2, where the class Books and Library come together. Once the database has books added or removed, the books.txt file updates// 

//Make sure you copy and paste all three or else the code will not run properly//
